The ESD database was recorded with the aim to provide the community with a large emotional speech database with a sufficient variety of speaker and lexical coverage.

The ESD database consists of a total of 29 hours of audio recordings from 10 native English speakers and 10 native Chinese speakers, covering 5 different emotion categories (neutral, happy, angry, sad and surprise). It represents one of the largest emotional speech databases publicly available, in terms of speakers and lexical variability. All the recordings are conducted in the studio with professional devices to guarantee audio quality.
